# Water Inundation Experiment Analysis

This is the analayis of a large shade house experiment on water inundation in Sabah, Borneo. Ten species of Dipterocarps were subject to 8 varying levels of water inundation along a continuous gradient for approximatly three months.  

To run the analysis your self:
- Fork the repo
- Clone the repository to you computer 
- Install the R packages if you do not already have them (ggplot2, lme4, arm). For example, install.packages("ggplot2").
- Open in editor and run
- NOTE: I am using R version 3.3.3 (2017-03-06), Another Canoe...
